## 🎯 Google Play Console Link Status

### To Check if Linked to Google Play Console:

You need to verify **3 things**:

#### 1. Is the App Created in Google Play Console?
- Go to: https://play.google.com/console
- Look for app: **ISMPH Media Tracker** or package `com.ismph.mediatrackerapp`

**Status:** ❓ Need to verify manually

#### 2. Is a Service Account Configured?
For automated submissions via `eas submit`, you need a Google Play Service Account JSON key.

**Check if you have it:**
```bash
eas credentials -p android
```
Select: **production** → **Google Service Account Key**

**Status:** ❓ Need to check

#### 3. Has the App Been Uploaded?
Check if any builds have been submitted to Google Play Console.

**Your recent builds:**
- Build `c2281a3a` (Dec 2, 2025) - ✅ Finished
- Build `ec3a9d8c` (Dec 2, 2025) - ✅ Finished

**Status:** ❓ Need to verify if submitted

## 📋 How to Verify Google Play Console Link

### Step 1: Check Google Play Console

1. Go to: https://play.google.com/console
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Look for your app: **ISMPH Media Tracker**

**If you see the app:**
- ✅ App is created in Google Play Console
- Check the **App signing** section for SHA-1 fingerprints

**If you don't see the app:**
- ❌ App not yet created in Google Play Console
- You need to create it first

### Step 2: Check EAS Credentials

Open PowerShell and run:

```bash
cd c:\Users\Stephen\ISMPH--1
eas credentials -p android
```

When prompted:
1. Select: **production**
2. Look for: **Google Service Account Key**

**If you see it:**
- ✅ Service account is configured
- ✅ You can use `eas submit` to upload to Play Store

**If you don't see it:**
- ❌ Service account not configured
- ❌ You need to set it up for automated submissions

### Step 3: Check Build Submissions

Run:
```bash
eas submit:list --platform android
```

This will show if any builds have been submitted to Google Play Console.

## 🔐 About the SHA-1 Fingerprint

### Your Current Keystore SHA-1
Based on your builds, EAS is managing your keystore. To get the SHA-1:

```bash
eas credentials -p android
```

Select: **production** → **Keystore: View details**

You'll see the SHA-1 fingerprint.

### The SHA-1 You Want
```
C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1
```

**Important Questions:**

1. **Is this SHA-1 from Google Play Console?**
   - If YES → This is the **Play App Signing** key
   - Google Play creates this when you enroll in Play App Signing

2. **Or is this from your own keystore?**
   - If YES → You need to upload this keystore to EAS

## 🎯 Most Likely Scenario

### If Your App is Already in Google Play Console:

When you upload your first build to Google Play Console, Google creates a **Play App Signing key** with its own SHA-1 fingerprint.

**You'll have TWO SHA-1 fingerprints:**

1. **Upload Key SHA-1** (your EAS keystore)
   - Used to sign builds before uploading
   - Example: `28:B1:56:77:C5:02:46:54:D1:F0:CF:E6:E3:ED:E8:AE:07:C8:0A:24`

2. **App Signing Key SHA-1** (Google Play's key)
   - Used by Google Play to sign the final APK
   - This might be: `C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1`

**For Firebase/Google Services, you need to add BOTH SHA-1 fingerprints!**

---

## ✅ Action Items

### 1. Check Google Play Console

```
Go to: https://play.google.com/console
Look for: ISMPH Media Tracker (com.ismph.mediatrackerapp)
```

**Find:**
- App signing key certificate (SHA-1)
- Upload key certificate (SHA-1)

### 2. Check EAS Credentials

```bash
eas credentials -p android
# Select: production → Keystore: View details
```

**Get:**
- Your current keystore SHA-1

### 3. Add Both SHA-1 to Firebase (if using Firebase)

Go to Firebase Console:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com
→ Project Settings
→ Your Android app
→ Add both SHA-1 fingerprints
```

---

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check EAS credentials
eas credentials -p android

# Check build history
eas build:list --platform android

# Check submission history
eas submit:list --platform android

# Submit latest build to Play Store
eas submit --platform android --latest
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### About Play App Signing

When you upload your first build to Google Play Console, you'll be asked to enroll in **Play App Signing**.

**This creates TWO keys:**
1. **Upload key** (your EAS keystore) - for uploading builds
2. **App signing key** (Google's key) - for signing final APKs

**The SHA-1 you mentioned might be the App Signing key from Google Play!**

### For Firebase/Google Services

You need to add **BOTH** SHA-1 fingerprints:
- ✅ Upload key SHA-1 (from EAS)
- ✅ App signing key SHA-1 (from Google Play Console)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

**Please check:**

1. **Go to Google Play Console** (https://play.google.com/console)
   - Is your app there?
   - What SHA-1 fingerprints do you see?

2. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   eas credentials -p android
   ```
   - Select: production → Keystore: View details
   - What SHA-1 do you see?

3. **Tell me:**
   - Where did you get the SHA-1 `C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1`?
   - Is it from Google Play Console or your own keystore?

Then I can give you specific instructions! 🚀
