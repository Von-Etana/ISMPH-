# 🔧 Fix Google Play Console Signing Key Error

## ❌ The Error

Your Google Play Console is rejecting the app bundle because:

**Expected SHA-1 (registered in Google Play):**
```
C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1
```

**Actual SHA-1 (your current EAS keystore):**
```
28:B1:56:77:C5:02:46:54:D1:F0:CF:E6:E3:ED:E8:AE:07:C8:0A:24
```

**Error Message:**
> "Your Android App Bundle is signed with the wrong key. Ensure that your App Bundle is signed with the correct signing key and try again."

## 🎯 Root Cause

You previously uploaded a build to Google Play Console using a keystore with SHA-1 `C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1`.

Now EAS is using a different keystore (SHA-1 `28:B1:56:77:C5:02:46:54:D1:F0:CF:E6:E3:ED:E8:AE:07:C8:0A:24`).

**Google Play requires ALL updates to use the SAME keystore!**

## ✅ Solution: Upload Your Original Keystore to EAS

You need to find and upload the original keystore file that has SHA-1 `C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1`.

### Step 1: Locate Your Original Keystore

The keystore file is typically named:
- `my-app.keystore`
- `my-app.jks`
- `android.keystore`
- `release.keystore`

**Common locations:**
- Project folder
- `android/app/` directory
- Your computer's Documents folder
- External backup drive
- Email attachments (if you sent it to yourself)

### Step 2: Verify the Keystore SHA-1

Once you find the keystore, verify it has the correct SHA-1:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore path/to/your-keystore.jks -alias your-alias
```

**Look for:**
```
SHA1: C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1
```

**If you don't know the alias, list all aliases:**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore path/to/your-keystore.jks
```

### Step 3: Upload to EAS

Once verified, upload to EAS:

```bash
cd c:\Users\Stephen\ISMPH--1
eas credentials
```

**When prompted:**
1. Select: **Android**
2. Select: **production**
3. Select: **Keystore: Set up a new keystore**
4. Select: **Upload a keystore**
5. Provide:
   - **Keystore path**: `path/to/your-keystore.jks`
   - **Keystore password**: Your keystore password
   - **Key alias**: Your key alias (e.g., `my-app`, `release`, `key0`)
   - **Key password**: Your key password

### Step 4: Rebuild

After uploading the correct keystore:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Step 5: Verify SHA-1

Check that the new build has the correct SHA-1:

```bash
eas credentials -p android
```

Select: **production** → **Keystore: View details**

**You should see:**
```
SHA1: C8:9E:1C:F0:24:C0:80:FD:A3:DC:48:93:FF:D5:10:17:3F:A2:44:D1
```

### Step 6: Submit to Google Play

```bash
eas submit --platform android --latest
```

## 🚨 If You Can't Find the Original Keystore

### Option 1: Check Google Play Console for Upload Key

1. Go to: https://play.google.com/console
2. Select your app
3. Go to: **Setup → App signing**
4. Look for **"Upload key certificate"**

**If you see it:**
- Download the certificate
- This might help you identify which keystore you used

### Option 2: Reset App Signing (LAST RESORT)

⚠️ **WARNING:** This is a drastic measure and has consequences!

If you absolutely cannot find the original keystore, you may need to:

1. **Contact Google Play Support** to reset app signing
2. **Or create a new app listing** with a new package name

**Consequences:**
- ❌ Lose all existing users (they can't update)
- ❌ Lose all reviews and ratings
- ❌ Start from scratch

**Only do this if:**
- The app has no users yet
- You're willing to start over
